# Smart Car Park Surveillance: Machine Learning - Based Object Detection in Shopping Parking Space 🚗🏢

Welcome to  **Smart Car Park Surveillance: Machine Learning - Based Object Detection in Shopping Parking Spaces** project repository! This is my degree project showcasing a cutting-edge solution for urban parking management. 
Our platform is designed to assist city planners, drivers, and sustainability advocates by optimizing parking spaces through intelligent surveillance.
With features like real-time car detection, parking availability insights, and congestion reduction tools, our system is your one-stop solution for enhancing urban mobility and promoting sustainable urban development.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project leverages **machine learning**, **image processing**, and **urban planning** to optimize urban parking lot management using intelligent surveillance systems. The system employs the **YOLOv8 algorithm** for real-time object detection, enabling efficient identification of available parking spaces.

### 🔑 Key Features:
- **Detection and Analysis**: Utilizing the **YOLOv8 algorithm**, the system performs real-time image object recognition to accurately identify available parking spaces. This speeds up the parking process, reduces congestion, and enhances the user experience.
- **Extensive Data Collection and Preparation**: The project collected over **10,000 images**, which were cleaned and pre-processed to ensure high-quality data for training and analysis.
- **Sustainable Urban Development**: By optimizing parking infrastructure, this project contributes to **Sustainable Development Goal 9** by promoting innovative and sustainable urban technologies.

### 🧰 Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Object Detection Algorithm**: YOLOv8
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Ultralytics YOLOv8, etc

### 👍🏼 Benefits:
- Eases urban congestion by reducing the time required to find parking.
- Minimizes environmental impacts through efficient space utilization.
- Encourages smarter, more sustainable urban mobility.
- Provides a scalable and resilient solution for future urban challenges.
